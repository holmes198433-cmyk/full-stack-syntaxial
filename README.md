## Running the app

The server starts on **port 3000 by default**. You can override it by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=4000 npm start
```

When running on platforms that inject their own port (e.g., Render, Heroku, Railway), the app will automatically honor the provided `PORT` value.
